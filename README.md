- Have NodeJS installed

- do
```npm install```

- run grunt tasks:
	- serve - for simple starting server
	- test - for UI and BE unit tests
	- test-e2e - for protractor UI test

# TBD

All those panels like "programs" or "banner" or "discussions" - should have been moved to directives but not for now.
